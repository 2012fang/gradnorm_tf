# Gradient Normalization in TensorFlow
This project aims to provide a TensorFlow (1.14.0) implementation of the GradNorm algorithm from the paper "[GradNorm: Gradient Normalization for Adaptive Loss Balancing in Deep Multitask Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.02257)" by Chen et al. (2018).

The implementation replicates the results from the [PyTorch project by hosseinshn](https://github.com/hosseinshn/GradNorm).
